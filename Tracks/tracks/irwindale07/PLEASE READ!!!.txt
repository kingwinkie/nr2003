[1] IMPORTANT -- BEFORE YOU INSTALL!!!
====================================

This track is only multiplayer compatible with exact copies of itself. YOUR SERVER MUST BE HOSTING THIS EXACT TRACK <irwindale07> or <irwindale07_night> IN ORDER FOR YOU TO USE IT IN ONLINE PLAY.


[2] HOW TO INSTALL THE TRACK
====================================

After downloading the Irwindale2007.exe file from the website, simply run the installer and follow the prompts.  The installer will automatically place the track into the NASCAR Racing 2003 Season\tracks directory by default.


[3] KNOWN ISSUES
====================================

This track is by no means done, but i felt i needed public feedback to further develop it to its fullest extent.

A potential bug with the placement of the pace car has been reported, but has not yet been confirmed. Several attempts were made to correct this to no avail. If you have a solution, please feel free to offer it in our forums, or contact me privately.

Another issue is the tv cam 2. I felt the tv cam 1 and spectator cams were sufficient for this release to allow admins to get a good view of all the action. It will be updated in a future release.

Some users have noted that the night track seems too dark. This was done on purpose to better simulate the real tracks lack of lighting, and give it a more "local short track feel"

Users on lower-end video cards or processors may experience a hit in frame rates due to the large amount of textures included in this track.

Multiplayer compatible ONLY with other unmodified copies of <irwindale07> or <irwindale07_night> (See topic # 1 in this ReadMe).
