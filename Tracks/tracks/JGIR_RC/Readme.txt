Joes Gibbs International Raceway < JGIR > 

Description:  Welcome to the Joe Gibbs International Raceway!  This is a 7 mile Super Mega Speedway with a combination of Indy and Fontana shapes with a Fontana style frontstretch.  With a Fontana style main grandstand and Indy style pitroad, with author designed grandstands in the turns and two tunnels on one of the side straights, it is sure to provide a unique racing experience.  The track is concrete and wide enough for up to 4 wide racing – 5 if you have guts!   This track is built to honor Coach Joe Gibbs, one of the premiere figures in modern day sports in America and his race team Joe Gibbs Racing.  Each turn is dedicated to one of JGR's major sponsors with the final turn dedicated to the Washington Redskins, Coach Gibbs current employer.
      	JGIR is situated in Coach Gibbs'  place of birth, Mocksville, NC amid it's red clay and rolling hills and pine trees.  It comes with a drive in infield and victory lane which is situated halfway down the pitroad.  See the file readme for more description.  With the supplied setups you can look forward to racing at speeds around 250mph all the way around, no lifting and close in pack drafting action as you slingshot your way forward.  Enjoy racing JGIR and see you in victory lane!!!
